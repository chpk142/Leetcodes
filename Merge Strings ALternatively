# Merge Strings Alternately in C 

This repository contains a **C program** that merges two input strings **alternately**, character by character. If one string is longer, the remaining characters are appended at the end.

## Features
- **Efficient Merging:** Characters from both strings are merged in alternating order.
- **Handles Unequal Lengths:** Extra characters from the longer string are added at the end.
- **Optimized Memory Usage:** Uses `malloc()` for dynamic memory allocation.
- **Error Handling:** Checks for `NULL` in case memory allocation fails.

## Example
### **Input:**
```c
word1 = "abcdef";
word2 = "123456";

## Output
Merged String: a1b2c3d4e5f6
